Date: Karakuş Tumulus, İstanbul Archeology Museum Archive

Time: A summer afternoon to evening
Weather Conditions: Humid and rainy and drizzle  
Context: A multi-sensory research practice


a long one. took so long. worth it. 
supported by gsa. thank you gsa. and thank you daniel. 
The game boy. a friend. 
always walk 5 kilometres beyond. we did a good walk.
to clava tumulus. 4,000 years old. a stone circle in Inverness. 
the highlands and islands of scotland. a famous tumulus. 
inspired the tv show. outlander. 
craigh na dun. the fictional name. but. that's not the point. 
A special house for the special deads. 
a beautiful roofless house. made by the bronze age society. 
the point is the stone paths. the matrix. straight line to the sun. 
stones are aligned with the midwinter solstice. 
why? the astronomical alignment? the embodiment of unknown. 
the queer flirt of stone and sun. life to deads. light to graves. 
the point. dead is not end. the endless eddy. 
It's muddy everywhere. 
my raincoat on me. My storm umbrella protect my cameras.
daniel is recording the bird sounds. 
people are speaking in the background.
the sun comes and goes. eddying around the architecture of the frozen music. 
my eddying is based on the geometric pattern.
becoming a drop of rain. that is the point.

Location: From Glasgow to Bathgate
Time: 4:45
whispering. with winds. birds. Sheeps.
the 1st field research.
Cairnpapple known by its rituals. 
tea is always part of my ritual.
i trusted the sun.
it was as dark as underneath of the tumulus
as cold as the moon.
we were actually in the space tumulus!
there were a high up stairs to the hill
you only see the sky at the end. nothing else.
sema means the sky in Turkish.
the wind is always there in Scotland.
i walked around the tumulus multiple times and different direction.
my hands were shaking.
honestly, at that moment, i didn't know what i was doing anymore.
it is too much manipulation!
i kept walking, listening, thinking, freezing, un/digging!
